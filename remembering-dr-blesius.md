<h4 align="center">&#10038; 29 November 1937 &ndash; &#8224; 4 March 2019</h4>

<p>Dr. Cornelius (Nels) Klaus Blesius, 81, passed away on March
4, 2019. He was an intelligent, optimistic, big-hearted man, who was
loved and full of personality. He will be remembered as a caring
husband, father, Opa, physician, and one of El Paso’s biggest
fans.</p>

<p>He was born in Berlin, Germany to Nikolaus and Erica Blesius
in 1937. As a young boy he lived through WWII and learned the
life-long traits of perseverance, survival, and the ability to
overcome adversity with optimism and conviction. He survived the war
and post-war food crisis by relying on family on the Moselle River
and elsewhere in Germany.</p>

<p>After the war, he studied philosophy, germanistics, art history,
and medicine in Freiburg and Berlin. He went on to complete
clinical internships in Berlin, Heidelberg, and San Juan, Puerto
Rico. As a teeneager, he dreamed of living in America. He realized his
dream by applying for a U.S. Visa. He was given a green card and the
opportunity to head an emergency room in New Jersey. He traveled when
he could and fell in love with the wide open spaces, the sky, and
the weather of the American Southwest. He later found a way to move to
the Southwest by working alongside the Sears Foundation to establish the
Bovina Medical Center in the Texas panhandle. While running the
clinic, he applied for and was accepted to another residency in
Internal Medicine at Baylor University Medical Center in Dallas,
Texas. During this period he became a pilot, purchased an airplane, and
commuted between Dallas and Bovina until a replacement could be found.</p>

<p>It was during his residency at Baylor that he met his wife of 48
years, Rita Fae Clark. Rita was a nursing student at Baylor
University. They married in 1971 in St. Petersburg, Florida. After
completing his residency program, he sought out and embraced the
opportunity to practice medicine in the West Texas town of El Paso,
which at the time was a medically underserved area. This was the
beginning of a long stimulating career in the Sun City. He prided
himself in providing excellent care to his patients. Over the years he
has cared for thousands of patients who sought out his careful and
thorough diagnostic workups. He loved his patients and practicing
medicine in El Paso until he retired at the age of 79.</p>

<p>In his free time, he enjoyed reading, playing classical and baroque
music, piloting his own plane, attending bible study, and appreciating
the light and beauty found in the sunsets of El Paso from the balcony
of his own home.</p>

<p>His life in the United States was always punctuated with the
relationships he sustained with friends and family on the Moselle 
River, in the Rhine River valley, and elsewhere. This contact brought
him joy.</p>

<p>He was preceded in death by his parents, Nikolaus and Erica Blesius
and his brother Wolf Ludwig Blesius. He is survived by his wife, Rita,
his son Carl with wife Robin; his daughter Fae and her
husband William; and his seven wonderful grandchildren. He is missed by
family and friends.</p>

<blockquote><p>Ich heisse Ulrich Riske, wohne in S&atilde;o Paulo,
Brasilien. [...] Wir waren bester Freunde w&auml;hrend meiner Jahre
(1954/1955) in dem Internat in Schl&uuml;chtern. Er war intelligent,
aufgeschlossen, witzig. Wir haben uns mal unter dem Dach dieses
ehemaliger Bauernhofes eine Bude eingerichtet - nach unserem Leitsatz:
Nur das unbedingt N&ouml;tigste rein!  Hier haben wir &uuml;ber existenzielle
Probleme diskutiert und dazu Pfeife geraucht. Ich errinere mich an
seinen Witz: Weisst du warum der Tabak beim Anzunden nach oben geht?
Weil er sehen will we da zieht.  Good bye, Cornelius" </p>

<blockquote> <p>I often think of Cornelius. He was an extraordinary
person. I remember my medical elective period (Famulatur) with him in
El Paso very well, where I met the American part of my family. You all
welcomed me so warmly, thank you very much. I remember our work
together at Southwest Diagnostic Institute. He was extremely well
educated and could interact with patients in such a very special
way. I learned a lot. We would then sit together in the evenings,
talking about wine, Germany, America, the universe, and everything. My
father und Cornelius were cousins. Alex (or „Alfons" as Cornelius
named my father) told me stories about the times the two where
kids. He paid him at lot of attention and so do I. I will definitely
never forget Cornelius, my uncle, the great physician, the
unconventional thinker, the warm hearted person.  </p>

<blockquote> <p>The conversations shared with Nels were always
  stimulating and genuine. The short time I was privileged to share a
  bible study class with him has made a deep and lasting impact on my
  approach to scripture. I say “shared the class with him” because he
  brought more knowledge to the class than I ever did as teacher. I
  left the lesson each time with more questions from Nels than we
  answered. I’d spend the next week digging through material and
  topics Nels had shared barely equipped for the next lesson before
  Nels would send me back to do more research the next week. The
  impact this made on the way I’ve approached bible study and my study
  of history continues. I have often have a comment from Nels ringing
  in my ears as I piece together a material for a new lesson. The
  study of John 1 specifically has completely re-colored my
  understanding our Lord and Heavenly Father. I continue to share
  those insights stimulated by Nels with anyone who will give me time
  to explain the original language and the message of this text. It
  was his genuine love for God and sincere good will that he projected
  to everyone he touched that will always last. To be recognized by
  someone of Nels caliber is truly an honor that I’ll always
  appreciate. We love you Rita.</p> <footer>Christopher Licking, El

<blockquote><p>I met Nels in the mid 90's when Rita, his wife, was
working with me at a program in the William Beaumont Army Medical
Center. First met him at a party at my home for the people working at
the program. I later had the opportunity to visit the Blesius'
home. Nels was not only a good and caring physician, but he was truly
larger than life. I shall remember him always. Condolences to Rita and
the family.</p> <footer>Frank Giordano, MD, El Paso, March 2019</footer>

<blockquote><p> Carl and Family - sorry to see that your Dad
passed. Fondly remember great talks and stories with him back in our
El Paso High School days. Thoughts and love to you and your family.</p>

<blockquote><p> I will forever be eternally grateful for the guidance,
love &amp; generosity that was bestowed to me 38 years ago. You taught me
so much during my years of employment with you. I lovingly refer to
you as Nels, you will always be remembered fondly. With much love

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Mein letzter Gru&szlig; an meinen Vetter Cornelius</strong></p>

<p>Von Mamu, deinem Vetter in Deutschland</p>

<p>Lieber Corni,</p>

<p>Wir haben in den vergangenen Jahren, ja fast Jahrzehnten
regelm&auml;&szlig;ig miteinander gesprochen, du aus den USA und ich
aus Deutschland. Und meist hast du angerufen mit den Worten:“ Ich
wollte dir nur sagen, hier in El Paso ist alles ok.“ Und dann haben
wir &uuml;ber Gott und die Welt geredet, &uuml;ber die Familie bei euch und bei
uns. Nur als ich vor wenigen Tagen einen Anruf von deinem Sohn Carl
aus El Paso bekam, wusste ich, dass alles nicht mehr ok in El Paso
war. Du hast uns verlassen.</p>

<p>In meiner Erinnerung begann unsere enge Bindung, als du in den 60er
Jahren Student in Berlin warst, einer Stadt, die damals ein Brennpunkt
der internationalen Politik war. Ich habe dich dort besucht, wir haben
uns dann h&auml;ufiger in Heidelberg, wo du ebenfalls studiert hast,
getroffen, in Freiburg im Schwarzwald, wo deine Mutter lange Zeit
gelebt hat. Wenn du deine Verwandten von der Seite deines Vaters an
der sch&ouml;nen Mosel besucht hast, warst du auch bei uns, nicht weit
davon entfernt, zuhause. Du hast deine Verbindung zur alten Heimat und
zu unserer Großfamilie mit gro&szlig;em, bewundernswertem Interesse &uuml;ber
Jahrzehnte, die du dann schon in den USA warst, aufrecht erhalten. Das
habe ich immer bewundert und daf&uuml;r bin ich dir von Herzen dankbar.</p>

<p>Deine Liebe zur alten Heimat in Deutschland hast du auch auf deinen
Sohn Carl &uuml;bertragen, der lange Zeit in deinem geliebten Heidelberg
studiert und dabei auch als 3. Kind zeitweise in unserer Familie
gelebt hat. Und auch daf&uuml;r bin ich dir von Herzen dankbar.</p>

<p>Du warst ein kluger Kopf, weit &uuml;ber deinen medizinischen Bereich
hinaus, voll von Wissen und voller Neugier. Wir haben bei meinen
Besuchen hier in El Paso stundenlang &uuml;ber die Vergangenheit in
Deutschland und heutige Politik in den USA diskutiert, lebhaft, auch
wenn diese Diskussionen nicht immer ganz einfach waren. Sie waren aber
immer h&ouml;chst interessant und haben geholfen, unsere eigenen Positionen
nochmals zu &uuml;berdenken. Doch das ist jetzt vorbei. Mir wirst du
fehlen.</p>

<p>Lieber Corni, Du hast jetzt deine letzte Reise angetreten.</p>

<p><strong>Ruhe in Frieden</strong></p>

<p>Und wir werden uns wiedersehen, ganz bestimmt.</p>

<p>Dein Vetter Mamu</p>
